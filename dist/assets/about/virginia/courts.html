<h4>Personhuballah v. Alcorn</h4>
<p>This case was filed in 2013 to challenge Virginia’s Third Congressional District as a racial gerrymander. In 2014, a district court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, determining that the district was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. When this decision was appealed to a higher court, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated and remanded the case back to the district court for reconsideration in 2015. The district court ruled, again, in favor of the plaintiff. After the U.S. Supreme Court found that the case lacked standing to appeal, an outside expert was commissioned to redraw the districts to remedy the gerrymander. A new remedial plan was implemented in 2016.</p>

<h4>Vesilind v. Va. State Board of Elections</h4>
<p>This case was filed in 2015 to challenge state General Assembly districts for violating Virginia’s constitutional requirement to draw compact districts. The district court ruled that the districts were constitutionally valid in 2017. When this decision was appealed, the Virginia Supreme Court upheld this ruling.</p>

<h4>Bethune-Hill v. Virginia Board of Elections</h4>
<p>This case was filed in 2014 to challenge 12 State House districts as racial gerrymanders. In 2015, a district court ruled that race did not predominate in 11 of the 12 districts, but race was considered when drawing one district (District 75). However, the court determined that considering race in District 75 was not unconstitutional because the parameter used, a 55% Black voting age population, was justified by the VRA due to highly racially polarized voting in the area of concern. When this decision was appealed to a higher court, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the rationale for District 75 but vacated and remanded the case back to the lower court for the remaining 11 districts. In 2018, the district court amended their ruling, determining that the remaining 11 districts were racial gerrymanders, initiating a redistricting process. In early 2019, a new map was approved. The Virginia House of Delegates appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court (Virginia House of Delegates v. Bethune-Hill), but the court found that the state House lacked standing to appeal.</p>
